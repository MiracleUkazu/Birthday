            <small>Hey <span>My Sweet</span> Dad</small>
            <h1>I Love <span>You</span></h1>
            <p>My heart feels so full yet heavy as I write this to you on your birthday. I wish more than anything I could be there with you today, giving you the biggest hug and telling you this in person instead of through words on a page.
                Sometimes when I'm alone, tears come to my eyes just thinking about how long it's been since I've seen you. I want you to know, with absolute certainty, that not a single day goes by where I don't carry your love with me. You are, and always will be, one of the greatest gifts in my life.
                You know, in moments when my faith in God wavers and I question everything, I think of you. Having you as my father feels like proof of divinity- because how else could I have been blessed with a dad like you? You make me believe in something bigger than ourselves.
                Please never, ever doubt how deeply I love you. If I could have one wish right now, it would be to wrap my arms around you and tell you how much I love you. You mean everything to me and more, Dad.
             <br> <br>
             Happy Birthday Day, <span>my love.</span> I love you more than you know.
            </p>
